          I have a desire to learn more about technical design as well as web development. This includes my enrollment in UT-Austinâ€™s Coding Boot Camp, where I am in training to become a full-stack web developer. Currently, I am deepening my understanding of newly acquired skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, and MySQL. I plan to further broaden my knowledge of web development by learning TypeScript, Java, Python, and C#. In addition, I practice photography and my photo editing skills in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop in my spare time. 
          </p>

          I am a quick learner and creative problem-solver, who is highly organized and takes initiative.  I value the importance of interpersonal skills and am a strong communicator. Using these skills, I serve as a product manager at an e-commerce startup. My experience in this position has inspired me to pursue opportunities where I may leverage my degree in Business Administration in International Business to bridge communication between web development and product management. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I am actively learning and look forward to new career opportunities, so please feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
